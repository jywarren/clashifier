##Clashifier##

Clashifier is open source software, and is part of open source research by the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science.

To use Clashifier, you can:

* Train it with a "classname" and a set of corresponding color bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared)
* Find the nearest classname to a set of color bands (and their relative cartesian distance)
* (soon) point it at the URL of an image to get back an image color-coded by classname
* (soon) "draw" on an image in-browser with a colored "pen" to classify pixels from that image and train a model

We hope this will be useful for:

* automatically classifying aerial imagery by land use or type
* detecting and quantifying geographic events like oil spills or chemical seeps
* identifying different plant species, especially in a monoculture as found in wetlands
* (maybe?) identifying crop diseases

This project is in early-stage development and we really need all the help we can get! Get in touch on the Public Laboratory mailing list (sign up at publiclaboratory.org/user/register to join) and pitch in!

Depends on:
########################

* RMagick
* rmagick gems, paperclip

########################
To do: 
########################

* Get Classifier controller running
	* Start accepting a set of pixel color values {:n => 255, :r => 255, :g => 255, :b => 255, :classname => "spartina alterniflora"} to train a model

Later: 

* Actually install Paperclip and get it accepting image uploads or URL image uploads
* Get RMagick reading the saved images
* Some kind of interface? or keep this as a web service and let clients figure out interface... I'll write one for MapKnitter...

Later on:

* Consider normalized RGB: R/(R+G+B) to reduce lighting effects?
* Other classification techniques: SVM, KNN, Neural network
