Depends on:

* RMagick
* naive_bayes, rmagick gems, paperclip

To do: 

* Get Classifier controller running
* Actually install Paperclip and get it accepting image uploads or URL image uploads
* Get RMagick reading the saved images
* Figure out how to generate a string representation of a pixel in 3-4 color values which can be used to train a Bayesian model
* Start accepting a set of pixel color values {:n => 255, :r => 255, :g => 255, :b => 255, :classname => "spartina alterniflora"} to train a model
* Figure out how to store a Bayesian model in the database -- make a Rails model to store it.
* Some kind of interface? or keep this as a web service and let clients figure out interface... I'll write one for MapKnitter...
